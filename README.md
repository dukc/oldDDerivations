Intended to host Nix derivations for DMD D compiler. Based on the official
derivation on nixpkgs, but with ability to choose an older DMD instead. You
might want to use this if you have some outdated D code, and you want to use Nix
but don't want to spend time backporting the derivation yourself.

Empty for now, but should see some content soon!
